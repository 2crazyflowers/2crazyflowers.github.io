					<p>	I am fullstack web developer. I just finished an intensive fullstack coding program through the University of Minnesota. I enjoy coding and debugging websites. I love it when I get websites to look right and work perfectly!</p>
					<p>	My background is eclectic. After college I worked as a landscape designer and project manager for 5 years then went to bookkeeping and office management for 10 years as I needed to have part-time work to raise my family. I was promoted to Client Coordinator and got to work more to help my peers with video editing, email nurturing sequences and website editing. I found that I loved going deep into the code and figuring out how to make things do what it was supposed to and puzzling out issues on sites. I decided to learn more and started with online classes which just weren't enough. I started the coding program at the University and loved it. Now that I am done with classes, I am looking forward finding a job in we development in a firm that believes that work-life balance and a flexible work environment.</p>
					<p>	I am married to a great guy, have 2 children (who  keep me on my toes and astonish me daily) as well as 2 cats, 1 dog and 3 aquariums (and yes, we have a very full house!). I love spending time with my family and friends, traveling, hiking, kayaking and fixing up houses.</p>
