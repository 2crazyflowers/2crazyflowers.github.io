              <h5>I am a full stack web developer. I completed an intensive full stack coding program at the University of Minnesota. I am based in St. Paul, Minnesota. I am currently looking for a web development position. I really enjoy designing a website from front to back. </h5>
              <h5>As a former bookkeeper data and I are very comfortable with each other. I was a master at Excel and loved to analyze it.</h5>
              <h5>I find front end just as satisfying as I can use my design skills to make things look and feel right</h5>
              <h5>My background is eclectic. After college I worked as a landscape designer and project manager for 5 years. I then went to bookkeeping and office management for 10 years where I was promoted to Client Coordinator and got to work more to help my peers with video editing, email nurturing sequences and website editing. I found that I loved going deep into the code and figuring out how to make things do what it was supposed to and puzzling out issues on sites. I decided to learn more and started with online classes which just weren't enough. I started the coding program at the University and loved it. Now that I am done with classes, I am looking forward finding a job in we development in a firm that believes that work-life balance and a flexible work environment.</h5>
              <h5>	I am married to a great guy, have 2 children (who  keep me on my toes and astonish me daily) as well as 2 cats, 1 dog and 3 aquariums (and yes, we have a very full house!). I love spending time with my family and friends, traveling, hiking, kayaking and fixing up houses.</h5>
